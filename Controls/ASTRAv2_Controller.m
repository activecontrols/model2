% Version 2 Controller formulation for ASTRAv2. Structure consists of 2
% cascaded loops (technically three, but first loop is merged with the trajectory
% generation software.) 
%
% First loop is a PI Loop in charge of Vel -> Acceleration commands, fitted
% with anti-windup and soft-gatingcbased on attitude error.
%
% Second loop is an LQRi Loop in charge of Target Attitude -> Gimbal +
% Torque commands. Integral action is fitted with anti-windup clamps and is
% self soft-gated.
% Tuning of the second loop is done by using a Genetic algorithm to
% maximize a Crossover Frequency vs. Disk Margin tradeoff on all actuator
% channels.
